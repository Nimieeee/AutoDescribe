# 🔧 Netlify Environment Variables Fix

## ❌ Issue: "supabaseUrl is required"

Your Netlify build is failing because the Supabase environment variables are not set during the build process. Next.js is trying to generate static pages but can't access the Supabase client without the environment variables.

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. Made Supabase Client Build-Safe
**File**: `frontend-clean/src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Added fallback values for build time
- Prevents build failures when environment variables are missing
- Uses placeholder values during static generation

### 2. Added Runtime Environment Checks
**File**: `frontend-clean/src/lib/env-check.ts`
- Created utility to check if environment is properly configured
- Graceful handling of missing environment variables
- Shows helpful error messages to users

### 3. Updated Dashboard with Fallbacks
**File**: `frontend-clean/src/app/page.tsx`
- Added environment variable checks
- Uses demo data when Supabase is not configured
- Prevents runtime errors

## 🚀 Set Environment Variables in Netlify:

### Step 1: Go to Netlify Dashboard
1. Open your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your AutoDescribe site
3. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**

### Step 2: Add Required Variables
Click **Add variable** and add these:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

### Step 3: Get Supabase Values
If you haven't set up Supabase yet:

1. **Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)**
2. **Create account** → **New project**
3. **Project name**: `autodescribe`
4. **Wait for setup** (2-3 minutes)
5. **Go to Settings** → **API**
6. **Copy Project URL** and **anon public key**

### Step 4: Set Up Database Schema
1. **Go to SQL Editor** in Supabase
2. **Copy content** from `supabase-schema-clean.sql` in your repo
3. **Paste and run** the SQL

### Step 5: Redeploy
1. **Go back to Netlify**
2. **Deploys** tab
3. **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**

## 🎯 Expected Success:

After setting environment variables, your build should succeed:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (8/8)
✓ Build completed successfully
```

## 🔍 Verify Your Deployment:

### Test These URLs:
1. **Homepage**: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
2. **Generate**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/generate`
3. **Review**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/review`
4. **KPIs**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/kpis`

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Pages load without errors
- ✅ No "supabaseUrl is required" errors
- ✅ App shows proper content or setup instructions

## 🛠️ Alternative: Deploy Without Database First

If you want to deploy immediately without setting up Supabase:

### Option 1: Use Demo Mode
The app will now work with placeholder data when environment variables are not set.

### Option 2: Set Minimal Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://demo.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=demo-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://demo-backend.com
```
