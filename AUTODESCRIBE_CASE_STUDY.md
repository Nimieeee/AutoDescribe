## Technical Implementation

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

```typescript
// Core RAG Implementation
class CSVRAGService {
  async generateRAGContext(sku: string) {
    const targetProduct = await this.findProductBySku(sku);
    const similarProducts = await this.findSimilarProducts(targetProduct);
    const categoryProducts = await this.getProductsByCategory(targetProduct.category);
    const brandProducts = await this.getProductsByBrand(targetProduct.brand);
    
    return {
      targetProduct,
      similarProducts: similarProducts.slice(0, 5),
      categoryProducts: categoryProducts.slice(0, 10),
      brandProducts: brandProducts.slice(0, 8)
    };
  }
}
```

### AI Content Generation Pipeline

```typescript
// AI Service Integration
class AIService {
  async generateContent(params: GenerationParams) {
    const prompt = this.buildContextualPrompt(params.ragContext, params.contentType);
    
    const response = await this.mistralClient.chat({
      model: 'mistral-large-latest',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
      temperature: 0.7,
      maxTokens: 1000
    });
    
    return {
      generatedText: response.choices[0].message.content,
      tokensUsed: response.usage.totalTokens,
      model: 'mistral-large-latest'
    };
  }
}
```

### Quality Evaluation System

```typescript
// 5-Dimensional Quality Scoring
class QualityEvaluationService {
  async evaluateContent(content: Content, product: Product) {
    const scores = {
      technicalAccuracy: await this.evaluateTechnicalAccuracy(content, product),
      seoEngagement: await this.evaluateSEOEngagement(content),
      brandVoice: await this.evaluateBrandVoice(content),
      completeness: await this.evaluateCompleteness(content, product),
      creativity: await this.evaluateCreativity(content)
    };
    
    const overall = Object.values(scores).reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0);
    
    return {
      score: { ...scores, overall },
      qualityLevel: this.getQualityLevel(overall),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(scores)
    };
  }
}
