# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AutoDescribe RAG System is a comprehensive product copy generation platform that ingests product data, processes it through a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, and provides human-in-the-loop editing capabilities. The system aims to generate SEO-optimized, grounded product descriptions while maintaining quality through human oversight and automated evaluation metrics.

## Requirements

2. WHEN parsing product data THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (sku, name) are present
3. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL log the missing entries and continue processing valid records
4. WHEN processing product attributes THEN the system SHALL normalize breadcrumbs into breadcrumbs_text format
5. WHEN cleaning attributes THEN the system SHALL standardize color, size, weight, and dimensions fields
6. WHEN processing miscellaneous attributes THEN the system SHALL merge them into additional_text field
7. WHEN data cleaning is complete THEN the system SHALL save the cleaned dataset to PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 2: RAG Pipeline Implementation

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the system to generate grounded product copy using retrieval-augmented generation so that I can produce SEO-friendly descriptions at scale.

3. WHEN querying for relevant content THEN the system SHALL implement a retriever function that finds similar product attributes
4. WHEN generating copy THEN the system SHALL use prompt templates for long descriptions, bullet highlights, and variant copy
5. WHEN connecting components THEN the system SHALL integrate the retriever with Mistral AI LLM
6. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL include SEO keywords from breadcrumbs, product name, and brand
7. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement rule-based checks to prevent hallucinations
8. IF product attributes are missing THEN the system SHALL highlight missing values for human review

### Requirement 3: Editor Dashboard and Human Review

**User Story:** As an editor, I want to review and edit generated product copy in a user-friendly interface so that I can ensure quality and approve content before publication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display product specifications and generated copy side by side
2. WHEN viewing products THEN the system SHALL render structured product attributes clearly
3. WHEN reviewing content THEN the system SHALL display generated text fields (long description, bullets, variants) in editable format
4. WHEN editing content THEN the system SHALL allow real-time text modifications
5. WHEN reviewing content THEN the system SHALL provide "Approve" and "Reject" buttons with status logging
6. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL save edited versions back to the database
7. WHEN content is approved THEN the system SHALL allow CSV/JSON export of approved copy

### Requirement 4: SEO Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the generated copy to be SEO-optimized so that product pages rank well in search results while maintaining readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing product metadata THEN the system SHALL extract SEO keywords from breadcrumbs, product name, and brand
2. WHEN generating keyword lists THEN the system SHALL deduplicate and rank keywords by relevance
3. WHEN generating copy THEN the system SHALL include SEO keywords in the LLM prompt template
4. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL verify 80% or higher keyword inclusion rate
5. IF keyword coverage is below threshold THEN the system SHALL flag content for review

### Requirement 5: Quality Evaluation and Metrics

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want automated quality metrics and human review analytics so that I can monitor system performance and content quality over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating generated copy THEN the system SHALL calculate attribute coverage percentage (how many product specs are mentioned)
2. WHEN assessing readability THEN the system SHALL compute Flesch-Kincaid readability scores
3. WHEN analyzing SEO performance THEN the system SHALL track keyword coverage metrics
4. WHEN content is reviewed THEN the system SHALL log approval and rejection rates
5. WHEN editors work THEN the system SHALL track average editing time per SKU
6. WHEN quality is assessed THEN the system SHALL collect brand voice ratings on a 1-5 scale
7. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide evaluation dashboard with both automated and human review metrics

### Requirement 6: Success Criteria and Performance Targets

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want clear performance targets and success metrics so that I can measure the ROI and effectiveness of the AutoDescribe RAG system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN validating content accuracy THEN the system SHALL maintain ≤ 5% hallucination rate (incorrect product facts)
3. WHEN comparing to manual processes THEN the system SHALL deliver ≥ 60% time savings per SKU versus manual drafting
4. WHEN testing content performance THEN the system SHALL demonstrate ≥ 10% CTR lift in simulated A/B tests on sample pages
5. WHEN tracking system performance THEN the system SHALL monitor and report these KPIs in real-time dashboards
6. IF performance targets are not met THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic insights and improvement recommendations
7. WHEN calculating ROI THEN the system SHALL track cost savings from reduced manual effort and improved conversion rates
