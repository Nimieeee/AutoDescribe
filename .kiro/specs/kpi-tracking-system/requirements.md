# KPI Tracking System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive KPI (Key Performance Indicator) tracking system for the AutoDescribe RAG system. The system will monitor and measure performance across three critical dimensions: Data & System Quality (foundation), User Experience (interaction quality), and Business Impact (ultimate success). This tracking system will provide real-time insights, trend analysis, and actionable metrics to optimize system performance and business outcomes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data & System Quality KPIs (Foundation)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor data quality and system performance metrics, so that I can ensure the foundation of our RAG system is reliable and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes product data THEN it SHALL calculate the percentage of products with complete attributes (name, SKU, price, description)
2. WHEN evaluating data normalization THEN the system SHALL measure the percentage of products with consistent units for weight, size, and other attributes
3. WHEN processing search queries THEN the system SHALL track Precision@K metrics for retrieval quality
4. WHEN processing search queries THEN the system SHALL track Recall@K metrics for retrieval coverage
5. WHEN processing search queries THEN the system SHALL calculate Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for ranking quality
6. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN the system SHALL track response times, uptime, and error rates
7. WHEN data quality falls below 85% completeness THEN the system SHALL generate alerts
8. WHEN retrieval quality metrics drop below defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL flag performance issues

### Requirement 2: User Experience KPIs (Interaction Quality)

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to measure how users interact with the search and discovery features, so that I can optimize the user experience and reduce friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform searches THEN the system SHALL calculate Search Success Rate as percentage of queries returning relevant results
2. WHEN users interact with search results THEN the system SHALL measure Time to First Click
3. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL track Click-Through Rate (CTR) as percentage of result clicks
4. WHEN users complete sessions THEN the system SHALL collect Net Promoter Score (NPS) feedback
5. WHEN search success rate falls below 60% THEN the system SHALL trigger optimization alerts
6. WHEN average time to first click exceeds 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL flag user experience issues
7. WHEN CTR drops below 40% THEN the system SHALL indicate relevance problems
8. WHEN users refine queries multiple times THEN the system SHALL track query refinement patterns

### Requirement 3: Business Impact KPIs (Ultimate Success)

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to measure the business impact of the RAG system, so that I can understand ROI and make data-driven decisions about system investments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users complete purchase flows THEN the system SHALL calculate Conversion Rate as percentage of searches leading to purchases
2. WHEN tracking purchase behavior THEN the system SHALL measure Average Order Value (AOV) improvements
3. WHEN analyzing session value THEN the system SHALL calculate Revenue per Search Session
4. WHEN monitoring customer behavior THEN the system SHALL track customer churn and repeat purchase rates
5. WHEN conversion rate improves by 10% or more THEN the system SHALL highlight successful optimizations
6. WHEN AOV increases due to better recommendations THEN the system SHALL attribute revenue lift to the RAG system
7. WHEN customer retention improves THEN the system SHALL correlate improvements with search experience enhancements
8. WHEN calculating ROI THEN the system SHALL compare system costs against revenue improvements

### Requirement 4: Real-time Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities, so that I can quickly respond to performance issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN KPI metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL process and display them in real-time dashboards
2. WHEN critical thresholds are breached THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate issues
4. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable remediation suggestions
5. WHEN monitoring multiple metrics THEN the system SHALL provide consolidated health scores
6. WHEN trends indicate declining performance THEN the system SHALL proactively alert before critical failures

### Requirement 5: Historical Analysis and Reporting

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want historical KPI data and trend analysis capabilities, so that I can identify patterns, measure improvements, and generate executive reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing performance over time THEN the system SHALL provide daily, weekly, and monthly trend reports
2. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL calculate percentage changes and growth rates
3. WHEN generating executive reports THEN the system SHALL summarize key metrics and business impact
4. WHEN identifying optimization opportunities THEN the system SHALL highlight areas for improvement
5. WHEN tracking A/B tests THEN the system SHALL measure statistical significance of changes
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV and JSON formats for external analysis

### Requirement 6: Integration and Data Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with existing systems and robust data pipelines, so that KPI tracking doesn't impact system performance while providing comprehensive coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing APIs THEN the system SHALL add minimal latency overhead (< 50ms)
2. WHEN collecting KPI data THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous processing to avoid blocking operations
3. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL use efficient database schemas optimized for time-series data
4. WHEN processing high volumes THEN the system SHALL handle batch processing and data aggregation
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the KPI tracking SHALL scale horizontally without performance degradation
6. WHEN data consistency is required THEN the system SHALL ensure accurate metric calculation across distributed components

### Requirement 7: Privacy and Security Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want KPI tracking to respect user privacy and maintain data security, so that we meet regulatory requirements while gaining valuable insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting user interaction data THEN the system SHALL anonymize personally identifiable information
2. WHEN storing KPI data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data retention policies
3. WHEN accessing KPI dashboards THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls
4. WHEN handling sensitive metrics THEN the system SHALL encrypt data in transit and at rest
5. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove associated KPI data within compliance timeframes
6. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of who accessed what data when
